storing settings
  strategy one:
    create json from settings and keep dom synced with settings
      handle opening the webpage
      create method of saving settings
      create method of retrieving settings
  strategy two:
    save everything within live html that gets saved
      why do checkboxes and buttons reset?
      make it easier to save the webpage (naming of file?)
      update code to reference the dom instead of settings
      
activate
  turn on audioContext
  update status object
    get data from all groups and alarms
    update the status object
  determine next alarm (see above)
  // unhide elements?
  check whether clock time is correct?
